            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Akshaya Patra Foundation is a not-for-profit organization headquartered in Bengaluru, India. Founded in 2000, the foundation strives to eliminate classroom hunger by implementing the Mid-Day Meal Scheme in government schools and government-aided schools. Akshaya Patra aims to address two of the most pressing challenges faced by India – hunger and education – by providing wholesome meals to children, thereby incentivizing them to attend school regularly.</p>
            <p>With a vision that "No child in India shall be deprived of education because of hunger," Akshaya Patra has grown from serving 1,500 children in five schools to becoming the world's largest (not-for-profit) mid-day meal program, serving nutritious meals to over 1.8 million children in 19,257 schools across 12 states and 2 union territories in India.</p>
            <p>The foundation operates on a public-private partnership model, collaborating with the Government of India, state governments, and generous donors. Akshaya Patra's state-of-the-art kitchens ensure the preparation and delivery of hygienic and quality meals, which are customized to suit local tastes and preferences, thereby promoting both health and education.</p>
            <p>Beyond meals, Akshaya Patra also undertakes various other initiatives to support children's overall development, including scholarship programs, educational support, and community engagement activities. The foundation's work has been recognized globally, receiving numerous awards for its innovative approach and impactful programs.</p>
            <p>Join us in our mission to nourish the dreams of millions of children. Together, we can create a world where every child has the opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
